North Carolina Lighthouses
=====
Route Map of lighthouses along the NC Coast
---

This is a map that shows the route from the southernmost lighthouse in North Carolina to the northernmost lighthouse in North Carolina. The route along the roads were created using google maps, however, the ferry routes and points were found and created by hand using [this website.](http://geojson.io) The routes of actual roads were created by using a [website](https://mapstogpx.com/) that turns the google maps link into a GPX file. They were then uploaded to the geoJson website listed in the first link. The lines named 'road' were set to be solid lines, the lines named 'ferry' were set to be dotted lines. Libraries from JQuery and Leaflet were utilized to make this map happen.
